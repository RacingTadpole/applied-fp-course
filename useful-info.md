# Useful info for practical programs

## Database packages

- Beam (straightforward to use with existing data structures)
- Opaleye (postgres) - uses arrow syntax, adds barrier to entry
- Selda (similar to Beam)
- Persistent (supports Mongo, mysql, persistent) - but core query language is less flexible. Use with Esqlito.

## Web servers

- Servant  - express your API as a type. Approachable. Can generate the client code too (good if things change!). And the swagger docs.

## Input

- optparse-applicative (used in this course). Can do subcommands, generates help.

## Knowledge

- "What I wish I knew learning Haskell" - an incredible resource (QFPL always has it open in a tab)
